# Incremental backups with dump and restore

Can save/restore backups to/from mounted media and also via ssh.

I used it for many years on FreeBSD servers. Now i mostly use Apline linux, which [lbu](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_local_backup) until covers all my needs. So let it be just be there.

All scripts are self-documented (use `-h` flag).
